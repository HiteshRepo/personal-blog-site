## Project Overview

Architected and built comprehensive no-code/low-code platform enabling non-technical users to create enterprise applications through intuitive drag-and-drop interface, democratizing software development across organizations.

## Key Achievements

- Designed scalable component-based architecture using React frontend with Golang backend services, supporting dynamic application generation and real-time component rendering for complex business workflows
- Implemented robust data management layer with MySQL for persistent storage, Redis for caching frequently accessed components, and GraphQL for efficient client-server communication and flexible data querying
- Built asynchronous processing pipeline using RabbitMQ for handling application generation, deployment workflows, and background tasks, ensuring responsive user experience during complex operations
- Deployed cloud-native infrastructure on Kubernetes to support multi-tenant application hosting, auto-scaling, and isolated execution environments for user-generated applications
