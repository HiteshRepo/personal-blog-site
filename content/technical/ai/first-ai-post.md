# Adventures in AI: My Journey into the World of Large Language Models (LLMs)

Hi there! I’m **Hitesh Pattanayak**, and I currently work in the engineering vertical at [InfraCloud](https://www.infracloud.io/). As of this moment, you're reading the very blog I’m writing. So meta, right?

## The Start of Something LLM-azing

When I first dipped my toes into the vast ocean of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, I couldn’t help but wonder:

- What are these mystical "LLMs" everyone keeps talking about?
- How do they work? Do they have a secret society I need to join?
- How in the world do they get trained? Is there a gym for models? 🏋️‍♂️
- And what exactly is "fine-tuning"? Is it like tuning a guitar, but with data?

I had all these questions swirling around in my head. The problem? I had no idea where to start. Every time I searched for resources, I felt like I was playing a game of "information scavenger hunt" – bits and pieces scattered all over the internet. Oh, and did I mention, I was looking for **free resources**?

Not that I’m cheap, especially when it comes to learning! It’s just... why spend money on something when I’m not even sure it’s useful yet? For example, if I want to master **Kubernetes**, I’ll head straight to [Kodekloud](https://kodekloud.com/) – it’s a reliable platform. But for AI? It was a whole new ballgame.

## The Reality Check: Embracing the AI Learning Curve

I quickly realized that if I waited for the perfect, neatly structured resource to fall into my lap, I’d be old and grey before I even got started. (And while I love a good grey hair, I'd prefer not to wait that long.) So, I figured it’s now or never. Dive in, swim around, and try not to drown in the sea of **AI**, **GenAI**, **LLMs**, and **RAGs**.

And hey, while I’m at it, why not blog about it? Writing helps me process and retain information. Plus, if I can make sense of this, maybe I can help others too!

## Learning Isn't Linear: My Approach to AI

Spoiler alert: **learning is messy** – especially when you’re tackling a new subject. (New for me, at least. Some of my colleagues seem to have been born with a neural net installed in their brains.)

So, how do I start? It helps that in my organization, there are some folks grinding away on cutting-edge AI stuff. These people are so deep into AI, they probably dream in machine code. While I find it hard to keep up with them, there’s a silver lining: they’ve put together a handy list of resources for beginners like me. **Thank you, geniuses!**

## The AI Learning Path: Choose Your Adventure

The resources are split into three main categories based on API use cases:

1. **AI Ops** – If you want to make machines manage machines. Because why not?
2. **AI Cloud** – The magic of AI, but make it float on a cloud. ☁️
3. **AI Apps** – Cool AI-powered applications. Because, let’s face it, we all love apps.

To ensure you don’t get in over your head too quickly, each category is further divided into three difficulty levels:

- **Crawl** – Baby steps. You won’t break a sweat. 🍼
- **Walk** – A leisurely stroll. Maybe bring some snacks. 🍿
- **Run** – Full sprint. You might want to stretch first. 🏃‍♂️

So, the game plan is simple: pick a category (I’m going with **AI Apps**), start at **Crawl**, and level up from there. Easy enough, right?

## My AI/ML Experience (or Lack Thereof)

Let’s take a brief stroll down memory lane, shall we?

1. In one of my previous organizations, I took a course on creating classifiers and regression models. We dabbled with cool algorithms like **Random Forest** and played with datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). We used **Python** and [Google Colab notebooks](https://colab.google/) to work through everything. Sounds impressive, right? Well, here’s the kicker: I don’t remember any of it. Like, **none**. Because if you don’t use it, you lose it.

2. At another company, I was part of a hackathon team that built a [chatbot using the RASA library in Python](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1871lZczt2J5yqcImu9U6S05EBVVb_4_d6_L7-7mZvv4/edit#slide=id.ge45ed6d002_0_0). Spoiler alert: we **won** the hackathon! 🎉 But guess what? I didn’t retain that info either. Seems to be a pattern with me, huh?

So, basically, I’m starting from scratch. 🫠 But hey, that’s okay! This time, I’m going to take a top-down approach to learning AI. Why? Because starting from the bottom just feels like too much work.

## Stay Tuned for More AI Insights

So that’s where I am right now – at the beginning of a new AI journey. Stick around, and I’ll share everything I learn along the way. Let’s see if I can retain it this time... fingers crossed! 🤞

Until next time!
